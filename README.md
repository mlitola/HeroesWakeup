# HeroesWakeup
Very basic alarm clock app made with Qt5.12

## Description

### Requirements:
- Qt creator +4.8 
- Qt5 runtime

The project can be compiled using the Qt creator. This project was made with version 4.8 and with Qt version 5.12.

### Resources and templates
I have included some graphic templates that can be used for making custom grahics. Included also a alarm sound for demo purpose.

### Running the binary:
Run from command line i.e.
